# Forward modelling for EEG data using FieldTrip

This repository contains demo scripts for forward modelling (and to be updated with inverse modelling) of EEG data using FieldTrip. 
The scripts are created in the context of the Language Function and Dysfunction Lab at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour.
They are meant to be verbose with respect to comments in the scripts, but are not supposed to be a tutorial on the different source modelling steps.
